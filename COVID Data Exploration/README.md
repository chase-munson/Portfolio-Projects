## COVID Data Exploration

### Overview

This project aimed to develop a basic understanding of a data analysis pipeline. The project involved pulling data from Microsoft SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio and exporting it for use in simple Tableau visualizations. The project was focused more on the overall process than on the SQL queries and visualizations used. The end result was a basic Tableau dashboard, which can be found at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDDataExploration_17660107005600/COVIDDataExploration?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

### Steps

- Imported the dataset into a local Microsoft SQL Server Development Environment.
- Performed basic queries using SQL Server Management Studio to prepare the required data for visualizations.
- Extracted the data and performed final adjustments in Excel, such as converting NULL values to 0.
- Created basic visualizations in Tableau and created a final dashboard for publication.
